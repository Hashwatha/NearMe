            As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a widely recognized waterfall by the name "Ramapuram Waterfalls" in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.
            It's possible that it could be a local or lesser-known waterfall that hasn't gained widespread attention. 
            If it's a newly discovered or named waterfall, you may want to check with local tourism authorities or explore local travel resources for more information about its location, accessibility, and any associated attractions or amenities.
