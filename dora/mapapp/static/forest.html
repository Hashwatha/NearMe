            The Seshachalam Forest is located near Tirupati in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. 
            It is renowned for its rich biodiversity, comprising various flora and fauna species. 
            The forest is also home to the sacred Tirumala Hills, which are an important pilgrimage site for Hindus, particularly due to the presence of the renowned Venkateswara Temple, also known as the Tirumala Temple.
