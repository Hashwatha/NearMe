            As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a widely recognized dam named "Kalyani Dam" in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.
            However, it's possible that there may have been developments or construction of new dams since then.
            If "Kalyani Dam" is a newly constructed or renamed dam, I recommend checking local government sources, tourism websites, or recent travel guides for the most accurate and up-to-date information about it.
