            Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park, located near Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, India, is one of the largest zoological parks in Asia. 
            It was established in 1987 and covers an area of about 5532 acres. The park is named after Lord Venkateswara, a form of the Hindu god Vishnu, who is worshipped at the nearby Tirumala Venkateswara Temple.

            It seems like you're asking about the ISKCON temple in Tirupati.
            ISKCON stands for the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a religious organization focused on the worship of Lord Krishna.
            In Tirupati, there is indeed an ISKCON temple known as the Sri Sri Radha Govinda Mandir.
            The temple is located near Alipiri in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India. 
            It is one of the prominent attractions for devotees and tourists alike in the area.

            As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a widely recognized waterfall by the name "Ramapuram Waterfalls" in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.
            It's possible that it could be a local or lesser-known waterfall that hasn't gained widespread attention. 
            If it's a newly discovered or named waterfall, you may want to check with local tourism authorities or explore local travel resources for more information about its location, accessibility, and any associated attractions or amenities.

            As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a widely recognized dam named "Kalyani Dam" in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.
            However, it's possible that there may have been developments or construction of new dams since then.
            If "Kalyani Dam" is a newly constructed or renamed dam, I recommend checking local government sources, tourism websites, or recent travel guides for the most accurate and up-to-date information about it.

            The forest is also home to the sacred Tirumala Hills, which are an important pilgrimage site for Hindus, particularly due to the presence of the renowned Venkateswara Temple, also known as the Tirumala Temple.
